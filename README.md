# Bowgeist

> **A high-performance, lightweight Klipper API server written in Go** — with built-in camera streaming and full Moonraker compatibility.

---

## 🔧 What is Bowgeist?

**Bowgeist** is a drop-in replacement for [Moonraker](https://github.com/Arksine/moonraker), designed for users who want a faster, more efficient backend for their Klipper 3D printer setup.

Built entirely in **Go**, Bowgeist is engineered for **low memory usage**, fast response times, and easy deployment — all while remaining compatible with existing Klipper frontends like **Mainsail**, **Fluidd**, and **Obico**.

## 🎯 Key Features

- ⚡ **Written in Go** — native binary, fast startup, minimal overhead
- 🧠 **Low resource usage** — ideal for SBCs and embedded setups
- 🎥 **Built-in camera streamer** — no need for external MJPEG/FFmpeg daemons
- 🔁 **Moonraker-compatible API** — works with existing UIs and plugins
- 🔐 Secure, modular, and easy to extend

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Seamless replacement for Moonraker in Klipper ecosystems  
- Serve printer state, control endpoints, and file APIs  
- Support real-time WebSocket updates and G-code streaming  
- Provide efficient local video stream with minimal CPU usage  
- Work great even on low-end devices like Raspberry Pi Zero 2 or Orange Pi
